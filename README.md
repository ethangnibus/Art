# Art
The following are some of my favorite art projects:

## CS ART!
Using [The Coding Train's Kinect and Processing3 Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmVNgdapJJM) as base, I wrote a program to capture a subject's movements and project it back on to themselves. This project got some really cool use at a local concert. Preparation for said concert is shown below:
